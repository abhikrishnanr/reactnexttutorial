# React Day 2 — State & Events Lab

This Create React App project is a React 19 + TypeScript playground that follows the "Day 2 — State & Events" lab outline. Each section in the UI mirrors the curriculum brief so trainees can interact with every concept: rerenders, `useState`, event typing, forms, effects, lifting state, and a Kerala Theatre-inspired seat booking simulator.

## Sections Included
1. **How React Re-renders** – Change the welcome message and watch React reconcile updates.
2. **useState Counter** – Increment, decrement, and reset local component state.
3. **Event Handling** – Trigger strongly typed mouse, change, and form events with a live console log.
4. **Form Handling & Validation** – Controlled movie form with inline validation and success feedback.
5. **useEffect Timer** – Cleanup-aware interval that shows elapsed seconds.
6. **Lifting State Up** – Seat selection buttons notify the parent component via callbacks.
7. **Seat Booking Simulator** – 5x10 grid with ₹150 ticket pricing, reset, and confirm actions.
8. **Quick Reference** – Cheat-sheet for common React event types and hooks.

## Running Locally
